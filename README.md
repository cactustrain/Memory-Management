# Memory-Management
Operating System Memory Management Simulation
This is a first year HND program that I wrote in VB 6.

In the days before virtual memory, programs were assigned memory in different ways.
This program simulates the different techniques used in the early days of computing.

You can see the program running by downloading the .exe file onto your system
The user guide explains how to use the program.
